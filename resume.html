SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER<br/>
<i>Since Jan. 2022</i><br/>
<ul>
<li>Worked on biometric algorithms for use in clinical and consumer health and wellness devices. Including: heart rate, beat‑to‑beat intervals,<br/>
breathing rate, energy expenditure, vo2max, resting heart rate, spo2, sleep hypnogram classification and more.<br/></li>
<li>Developed digital signal processing algorithms and pipelines operating on photoplethysmography and accelerometry data.<br/></li>
<li>Developed build, deployment, and general application infrastructure for biometric algorithm software packages that seamlessly target multiple<br/>
platforms and architectures, from embedded devices to cloud services.<br/></li>
<li>Developed software systems for the application of machine learning models on low‑level devices and embedded systems.<br/></li>
<li>Developed cloud‑based software systems for the benchmarking and regression testing of biometric algorithms, including massively parallel<br/>
data processing pipelines using AWS Batch.<br/></li>
<li>Development, maintenance and extension of CI/CD pipelines for the automated building, testing and release of software packages.<br/></li>
<li>Built and maintained systems for the building (and cross‑compilation) of software targeting various embedded platforms, including the Qualcomm<br/>
5100 platform, Qualcomm Hexagon DSP, ARM Cortex‑M33, STM32 and many more.<br/></li>
<li>Developed code generation tooling to auto‑generate foreign function interfaces for C based biometric algorithms in several target languages,<br/>
including Python and Kotlin.<br/></li>
<li>Improved code quality, reliability, correctness and robustness via the application of modern tools and techniques, including state‑of‑the‑art<br/>
static and dynamic analysis and fuzz testing.<br/></li>
<li>Improved software engineering practices throughout the organisation, including the introduction of static and dynamic analysis of code, linting,<br/>
automated formatting and an improved emphasis on integration and behavioural testing.<br/></li>
<li>Drove the improvement of engineering staff’s proficiency with low‑level and systems programming via knowledge transfer.<br/></li>

<ul>
<li>Developed system software for a wide‑band channelisation, dual‑resolution spectral signal detection and IQ data recording system. This system<br/>
channelises an 80MHz wide continuous IQ time signal to various narrower bandwidths; the channelised data is buffered for subsequent<br/>
extraction, classification, demodulation and decoding. The system also offers dual‑resolution spectral signal detection capabilities<br/>
(i.e. high‑time/low‑frequency resolutions for frequency hoppers and other short‑duration signals and low‑time/high‑frequency resolutions for fixed frequency<br/>
signals). The system is also capable of recording the input IQ time data stream to disk via a RAID configuration.<br/></li>
<li>Developed a multi‑threaded processing pipeline architecture for product system software, taking advantage of modern C++ features to improve<br/>
readability, maintainability and performance.<br/></li>
<li>Developed a custom highly‑concurrent network server implementation for SDR device command and control.<br/></li>
<li>Developed high‑speed network capabilities via the application of the Data Plane Development Kit. Facilitated the processing of sustained near<br/>
line speed data ingress on a 40GbE interface.<br/></li>
<li>Accelerated channelisation, spectral and direction‑finding processing tasks via the application of a GPGPU, using NVidia CUDA v10 and v11.<br/></li>
<li>Implemented a wide‑band channelisation process using a fast Fourier transform as a filter bank.<br/></li>
<li>Developed system software for a 3‑channel direction‑finder, capable of 6 million DF/s at an 80MHz instantaneous bandwidth, at a minimum<br/>
frequency resolution of 62.5Hz and with an RMS DF accuracy of 0.1 degree. This system employed both a 3‑channel Watson‑Watt DF algorithm<br/>
and interferometric algorithms for a 7 or 9 channel L‑antenna array and for a 6‑channel pentagonal array.<br/></li>
<li>Developed a beam‑forming correlative DF algorithm for use in conjunction with a circular antenna array.<br/></li>
<li>Developed a kernel density estimation algorithm for the purposes of DF result reduction.<br/></li>
<li>Worked on the development of a super‑resolution DF algorithm for the purposes of discerning the individual angles of arrival of several different<br/>
signals transmitted on a single frequency.<br/></li>
<li>Wrote and collaborated on technical documentation, covering: system and feature design and specification and interface definitions.<br/></li>
<li>Guided the work of team members via the use of agile development methodologies, including the use of stand‑ups, scrums, kanban and sprints.<br/></li>
<li>Improved general code quality and accelerated the on‑boarding of new employees via the introduction of a formal policy of code‑review and a<br/>
culture of unit and integration testing.<br/></li>
<li>Directed the development of a centralised logging environment for use in complex systems comprised of several distributed and networked<br/>
products using Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and Filebeats.<br/></li>
