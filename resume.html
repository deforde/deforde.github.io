        <h3>Peralex Electronics</h3>

        <em>Cape Town, South Africa</em><br/>

        SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER<br/>

        <em>Mar. 2014 ‑ Dec. 2021</em><br/>

        <ul compact>
          <li>Developed system software for a wide‑band channelisation, dual‑resolution
            spectral signal detection and IQ data recording system. This system channelises
            an 80MHz wide continuous IQ time signal to various narrower bandwidths; the
            channelised data is buffered for subsequent extraction, classification,
            demodulation and decoding. The system also offers dual‑resolution spectral
            signal detection capabilities (i.e. high‑time/low‑frequency resolutions for
            frequency hoppers and other short‑duration signals and low‑time/high‑frequency
            resolutions for fixed frequency signals). The system is also capable of
            recording the input IQ time data stream to disk via a RAID configuration.</li>
          <li>Developed a multi‑threaded processing pipeline architecture for product
            system software, taking advantage of modern C++ features to improve readability,
            maintainability and performance.</li>
          <li>Developed a custom highly‑concurrent network server implementation for SDR
            device command and control.</li>
          <li>Developed high‑speed network capabilities via the application of the Data
            Plane Development Kit. Facilitated the processing of sustained near line speed
            data ingress on a 40GbE interface.</li>
          <li>Accelerated channelisation, spectral and direction‑finding processing tasks
            via the application of a GPGPU, using NVidia CUDA v10 and v11.</li>
          <li>Implemented a wide‑band channelisation process using a fast Fourier
            transform as a filter bank.</li>
          <li>Developed system software for a 3‑channel direction‑finder, capable of 6
            million DF/s at an 80MHz instantaneous bandwidth, at a minimum frequency
            resolution of 62.5Hz and with an RMS DF accuracy of 0.1 degree. This system
            employed both a 3‑channel Watson‑Watt DF algorithm and interferometric
            algorithms for a 7 or 9 channel L‑antenna array and for a 6‑channel pentagonal
            array.</li>
          <li>Developed a beam‑forming correlative DF algorithm for use in conjunction
            with a circular antenna array.</li>
          <li>Developed a kernel density estimation algorithm for the purposes of DF
            result reduction.</li>
          <li>Worked on the development of a super‑resolution DF algorithm for the
            purposes of discerning the individual angles of arrival of several different
            signals transmitted on a single frequency.</li>
          <li>Wrote and collaborated on technical documentation, covering: system and
            feature design and specification and interface definitions.</li>
          <li>Guided the work of team members via the use of agile development
            methodologies, including the use of stand‑ups, scrums, kanban and sprints.</li>
          <li>Improved general code quality and accelerated the on‑boarding of new
            employees via the introduction of a formal policy of code‑review and a culture
            of unit and integration testing.</li>
          <li>Directed the development of a centralised logging environment for use in
            complex systems comprised of several distributed and networked products using
            Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and Filebeats.</li>
